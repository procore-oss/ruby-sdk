# Procore Gem

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/procore/ruby-sdk.svg?branch=move-to-travis)](https://travis-ci.org/procore/ruby-sdk)

## Installation & Usage

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem "procore"
```

## Making Requests

At the core of the gem is the `Client` class. Clients are initialized with a
`client_id` and `client_secret` which can be obtained by signing up for
Procore's [Developer Program](https://developers.procore.com/).

A client requires a store. A store manages a particular user's access token.
Stores automatically manage tokens for you - refreshing, revoking and storage
are abstracted away to make your code as simple as possible. There are several
different [types of stores](#stores) available to you.

The Client class exposes `#get`, `#post`, `#put`, `#patch` and `#delete` methods
to you.

```ruby
get(path, query = {})
post(path, body = {}, options = {})
put(path, body = {}, options = {})
patch(path, body = {}, options = {})
delete(path, query = {})
```

All paths are relative - the gem will handle expanding `client.get("me")` to
`https://app.procore.com/vapid/me`.

Example Usage:

```ruby
store = Procore::Auth::Stores::Session.new(session: session)
client = Procore::Client.new(
  client_id: "client id",
  client_secret: "client secret",
  store: store
)

# Get the current user's companies
companies = client.get("companies")

companies.first[:name] #=> "Procore Company 1"
```

## Usage

The first step is to place the user's token into the store. For this example,
the tokens will be stored in the Rails session. In the controller action that
handles the end of the [OAuth 2.0
Flow](https://developers.procore.com/documentation/oauth-introduction) add the
following code:

```ruby
def handle_callback
  if auth_hash.blank?
    redirect_to '/auth/procore'
  else
    auth_hash = request.env['omniauth.auth']

    # Create a new token to save into a store
    token = Procore::Auth::Token.new(
      access_token: auth_hash["credentials"]["token"]
      refresh_token: auth_hash["credentials"]["refresh_token"],
      expires_at: auth_hash["credentials"]["expires_at"]
    )

    store = Procore::Auth::Stores::Session.new(session: session)
    store.save(token)

    redirect_to root_path
  end
end
```

With the user's token stored, requests can be made from anywhere in the
application that has access to the Rails session.

```ruby
client = Procore::Client.new(
  client_id: Rails.application.secrets.procore_app_id,
  client_secret: Rails.application.secrets.procore_app_secret,
  store: Procore::Auth::Stores::Session.new(session: session)
)

client.get("me")
```

## Error Handling

The Procore Gem raises errors whenever a request returns a non `2xx` response.
Errors return both a message detailing the error and an instance of a
`Response`.

```ruby
begin
  # Use Procore Gem to make requests
  client.get("projects")

rescue Procore::RateLimitError => e
  # Raised when a token reaches its request limit for the current time period.
  # If you are receiving this error then you are making too many requests
  # against the Procore API.

rescue Procore::NotFoundError => e
  # Raised when the request 404's

rescue Procore::InvalidRequestError => e
  # Raised when the request is incorrectly formatted. Possible causes: missing
  # required parameters or sending a request to access a non-existent resource.

rescue Procore::OAuthError => e
  # Raised whenever there is a problem with OAuth. Possible causes: required
  # credentials are missing or an access token failed to refresh.

rescue Procore::AuthorizationError => e
  # Raised when the request is attempting to access a resource the token's
  # owner does not have access to.

rescue Procore::ForbiddenError => e
  # Raised when the request failed because you lack the required permissions.

rescue Procore::APIConnectionError => e
  # Raised when the gem cannot connect to the Procore API. Possible causes:
  # Procore is down or the network is doing something funny.

rescue Procore::ServerError => e
  # Raised when a Procore endpoint returns a 5xx response code.

rescue Procore::Error => e
  # Generic catch all error.

rescue => e
  # Something unrelated to Procore errored.
end
```

Note that all errors inherit from `Procore::Error`, so if you do not need to
handle each error uniquely you can just rescue from this base class to catch all
errors generated by this gem.

```ruby
begin
  client.get("projects")
rescue Procore:Error => e
  # Something went wrong.

  # Print the error class
  puts e.class

  # Print the error message
  puts e.message

  # Print the HTTP code
  puts e.response.code

  # Print the json error response
  puts e.response.errors

  # Print the headers
  puts e.response.headers
end
```

## Pagination
Endpoints which return multiple objects (a collection) will include pagination
information. The `Response` object has a `#pagination` method that will return
a hash which may conditionally contain the following keys:

```
:next  URL for the immediate next page of results.
:last  URL for the last page of results.
:first URL for the first page of results.
:prev  URL for the immediate previous page of results.
```

For example, on the first page of results the `#pagination` method will look
like:

```ruby
response.pagination

{
  next: "projects?per_page=100&page=2",
  last: "projects?per_page=100&page=5"
}
```

The `next` value will return the second page of results - which is expected as
all paginated responses start on page 1. The `last` value ends on page 5, so
there are another 4 pages to consume in order to get all the possible results.

### Navigating Through Paginated Results

To get the next page of results, just pass the url into `client#get`. You may
want to guard against the next page being potentially empty.

```ruby
first_page = client.get("projects")

if first_page.pagination[:next]
  next_page = client.get(first_page.pagination[:next])
end

puts next_page.pagination

{
  first: "projects?per_page=100&page=1",
  next: "projects?per_page=100&page=3",
  prev: "projects?per_page=100&page=1",
  last: "projects?per_page=100&page=5"
}
```

### Change Number of Results

You can pass a `per_page` query parameter in your request to change the page
size. The pagination links will update to reflect that change.

```
first_page = client.get("projects", per_page: 250)

puts first_page.pagination
{
  next: "projects?per_page=250&page=2",
  last: "projects?per_page=250&page=2"
}
```

Notice that because `per_page` has been set to 250, there are only two pages of
results (500 resources / 250 page size = 2 pages).

## Configuration

The Procore Gem exposes a configuration with several options.

```ruby
# config/initializes/procore.rb

require "procore"
Procore.configure do |config|
  # Base API host name. Alter this depending on your environment - in a
  # staging or test environment you may want to point this at a sandbox
  # instead of production.
  config.host = ENV.fetch("PROCORE_BASE_API_PATH", "https://app.procore.com")

  # Integer: Number of times to retry a failed API call. Reasons an API call
  # could potentially fail:
  # 1. Service is briefly down or unreachable
  # 2. Timeout hit - service is experiencing immense load or mid restart
  # 3. Because computers
  #
  # Defaults to 1 retry. Would recommend 3-5 for production use.
  # Has exponential backoff - first request waits a 1.5s after a failure,
  # next one 2.25s, next one 3.375s, 5.0, etc.
  config.max_retries = 3

  # Float: Threshold for canceling an API request. If a request takes longer
  # than this value it will automatically cancel.
  config.timeout = 5.0

  # Instance of a Logger. This gem will log information about requests,
  # responses and other things it might be doing. In a Rails application it
  # should be set to Rails.logger
  config.logger = Rails.logger

  # String: User Agent sent with each API request. API requests must have a user
  # agent set. It is recomended to set the user agent to the name of your
  # application.
  config.user_agent = "MyAppName"
end
```

## Stores

Stores contain logic for accessing, storing, and managing access tokens. The
Procore API uses expiring tokens - this gem abstracts away the need to manually
refresh tokens.

Available stores:

### Session Store

Options: `session`: Instance of a Rails session

For applications that want to keep access tokens in the user's session.

```ruby
store = Procore::Auth::Stores::Session.new(session: session)
```

### Redis Store

Options: `redis`: Instance of Redis
Options: `key`: Unique identifier to an access token

For applications which want to store access tokens in Redis. There's two
required options, `redis` which is an instance of a Redis connection, and `key`
which is a unique key which will be used to save / retrieve an access token.
The key will usually be the id of the current user.

```ruby
store = Procore::Auth::Stores::Redis.new(redis: Redis.new, key: current_user.id)
```

### ActiveRecord Store

Options: `object`: Instance of an ActiveRecord model.

For applications that store access token information on some user object.

The following columns **must** exist on the model you pass in:
`access_token`, `refresh_token` and `expires_at`.

```ruby
store = Procore::Auth::Stores::ActiveRecord.new(object: current_user)
```

### File Store

Options: `path`: Path to a file to store access tokens
Options: `key`: Unique identifier to an access token

Intended for command line applications, the File Store saves access token
information to disk. This way a user can run a CLI without needing to
authenticate every single command.

```ruby
store = Procore::Auth::Stores::File.new(path: "./tokens.yml", key: current_user.id)
```

### Memory Store

Options: `key`: Unique identifier to an access token

The most basic store - a token is kept in memory for the duration of a request.
This store type is not recommended for application usage - it is meant to be
used in tests.

```ruby
store = Procore::Auth::Stores::Memory.new(key: current_user.id)
```

## Full Example

```ruby
# In controller, callback from oauth
def handle_callback
  if auth_hash.blank?
    redirect_to '/auth/procore'
  else
    auth_hash = request.env['omniauth.auth']

    # Create a new token to save into a store
    token = Procore::Auth::Token.new(
      access_token: auth_hash["token"]
      refresh_token: auth_hash["refresh_token"],
      expires_at: auth_hash["expires_at"]
    )

    store = Procore::Auth::Stores::Session.new(session: session)
    store.save(token)

    redirect_to root_path
  end
end

# Somewhere else in the application
class ProjectsController
  def index
    @projects = client.get("projects", company_id: params[:company_id])
  end

  private

  def client
    @client ||= Procore::Client.new(
      client_id: Rails.application.secrets.procore_client_id,
      client_secret: Rails.application.secrets.procore_client_secret,
      store: Procore::Auth::Stores::Session.new(session: session)
    )
  end
end
```
